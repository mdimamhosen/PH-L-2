# 📘 Prisma Relations & Relational Filters

In Prisma, relations define how your models are connected. Prisma supports the following relationship types:

---

## 🔗 Types of Relations

### 1. One-to-One

- A record in one table is linked to **one** record in another table.

### 2. One-to-Many

- A record in one table can be linked to **many** records in another table.
- Example: One `User` can have many `Post`s.

### 3. Many-to-Many

- Multiple records in one table can relate to multiple records in another table.
- Example: A `Student` can enroll in many `Courses`, and each `Course` can have many `Students`.

## 🔍 Understanding Relational Filters in Prisma

Prisma provides relational filters like `some`, `every`, and `none` to filter **parent records based on related records**.

### ✅ `some`

Returns the **parent record** if **at least one** related record matches the condition.

```ts
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    Post: {
      some: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

📌 Only returns users who have **at least one post** that is `published: true`.

---

### ✅ `every`

Returns the **parent record** if **all** related records match the condition.

```ts
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    Post: {
      every: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

📌 Returns users where **all** their posts are published (if a user has 1 draft post, they won't be included).

---

### ✅ `none`

Returns the **parent record** if **none** of the related records match the condition.

```ts
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    Post: {
      none: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

📌 Returns users who have **no published posts** at all.

---

## ✅ Filtering Related Data Without Returning Empty Parents

### ❌ Problem:

```ts
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  include: {
    Post: {
      where: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

👎 This includes **all users**, even if they have no published posts. Their `Post` array will just be empty.

---

### ✅ Solution: Use `where` + `include`

```ts
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    Post: {
      some: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
  include: {
    Post: {
      where: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

✅ This ensures:

- You **only get users who have published posts**
- And you **only include published posts** for each user

## 📌 Summary: Relational Filters

| Filter | Meaning                             | Example Use Case                           |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| some   | At least one related record matches | Users who have at least one published post |
| every  | All related records must match      | Users where all posts are published        |
| none   | No related record matches           | Users who have no published posts          |

---

## 🎯 Pro Tips

- Always use relational filters (`some`, `none`, `every`) in the `where` clause when filtering based on related models.
- Use `include` with a nested `where` only to control what data is fetched — **not** to filter parent records.
